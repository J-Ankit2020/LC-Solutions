In this question we have to rot all the oranges  and tell the time so we cnt all the oranges in the matrix initially . And mantain a queue for bfs on that and initially add all the 2s in the queue than we pop all the 2s out one by one and go to 4 directions of them and check if there is 1 than we add it to the queue and follow the same. We check if there is any orange in queue if yes than increase time . **We check at last bcs at start we are at initial condition look example 3 if at start we increase time than the answer will be wrong cause it is the initial state** We than check if total element inserted and popped out from queue is equal to total oranges if yes than answer is time else -1 . ** dx and dy is for saving time of if and else for 4 directons**. We add total elements in the queue at a time in curr to keep track of oranges .
